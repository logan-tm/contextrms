# ContextRMS
"Contextual Relationship Management Software", a bookkeeping tool for those that juggle multiple hats/responsibilities and want to keep them separate.

This tool is based on the PIECEOFPIE (patent pending) classification method:

**Projects, Ideas, Entities, Concepts, Environments, Obligations, Formulas, Places, Items, Events**

This method aims to describe all actionable aspects of a singular context- such as an individual's personal, digital and social life- in a manner that is more easily documented. The original intention of building this tool was to create a centralized bookkeeping system for all of the above items, but it may also serve to lay the foundation for a pretty neat AI assistant framework as well.

Key:
* <u>*Classification*</u>: A means of describing an aspect of one's life using one of the ten Classifications of the PIECEOFPIE model. For example, I may classify my house as a "Place".
* <u>*Instance*</u>: The word describing a documented classification. In the previous example, the "Place" describing my house is an *instance* of "Place".
* <u>*Context*</u>: Every classification belongs to a parent context (or "owner"), though multiple contexts may relate to the same classification instance.
  * Most people only have one context. However, for those that need to wear multiple hats (such as small business owners) it becomes a hassle to juggle different accounts, profiles, logins, etc. Hence, this tool.
  * For example, I may choose to have a context for my home life and another for my work life. While they both contain Events, they may not correlate with one another.

The classifications are described further:

## Projects
*A task or collection of tasks at varying degrees of completion.*
Examples:
* A to-do list.
* A woodworking project.
* Kanban board.
## Ideas
*Notes or projects that may not yet be actionable but are worth tracking.*
Examples:
* Desk scratchpad.
* Notes app.
* Kanban board tech debt.
## Entities
*People, groups of people, business or similar that can be singled out by name or number.*
Examples:
* **My family.** Yes, dogs included.
* **My workplace.** Both the company, teams, and individuals can be represented as an Entity.
* **Facebook.** Facebook itself, friends, marketplace clients, etc.
* **SCP #426.** Though I am but a toaster, I am a perfect example. There is none other like me.

Note: Even though I can identify my car by a number (VIN), I do not consider it an entity. What is and is not considered an entity is up to the consumer of the tool.
## Concepts
*An abstract thought that serves to provide insight to other instances and/or contexts.*
Examples:
* **Fatherhood.** What does it mean to you? What does it mean to me? Describe it as a concept.
* **PIECEOFPIE model.** A concept I am documenting here.
## Environments
*A place (whether physical, metaphysical or digital) described by it's behavioral relationship to the context.*
Examples:
* **My home.** If I move to a new address, I did not lose my home. It's just located somewhere new. New place, same environment.
* **A broom closet repurposed into a server room.** The place is the same, but the environment has changed.
* **AWS production environment vs AWS development environment.** Same machine configuration (mostly), different use cases.
## Obligations
## Formulas
## Places
*A location (whether physical, metaphysical or digital) where individuals may interact, operate or congregate.*
Examples:
* **My house.** The physical address of where I live.
* **The company building.** Where one might interact with coworkers.
* **Facebook.** Though it's not a physical location, one might say "add me on Facebook" to a friend, insinuating a shared "place" to interact with one another.
